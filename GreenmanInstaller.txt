pip install pyinstaller

pyinstaller --hidden-import="googleapiclient" SmallUi.py --onefile
Got pyInstaller to work instead - in directory where source is, 
pyinstaller --hidden-import="googleapiclient" SmallUi.py --onefile
had to downgrade the google api version: pip install google-api-python-client==1.8.0

pyinstaller puts the generated exe in directory dist

Then copy other files to same folder, then 7zip credentials, SmallUi.exe, and three-kings.jpg

Then download nullsoft scriptable install system 2.46, then run it, pick
"Installer based on ZIP file" to create an installer.

The file it produces is what should sit on a download site.

pip install wix.py - didn't work
pip install py2exe worked, but py2exe didn't produce a runnable file (error, no module named 
  'PyQt5.sip)

The final product has a command prompt window - this should be the preview area instead of the 
internal box, or maybe keep both, but minimize what goes into the preview area, and have 
verbose output in the command window.
